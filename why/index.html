The Bread Poets' Society is a compendium of recipes in verse. You'll never again forget a recipe when you succumb to its pounding iambic rhythm! Masterpieces will overflow from your oven as you find yourself inspired by gastronomic euphony! 

Besides, my food poetry is about the only stuff I'm willing to make public. :)
