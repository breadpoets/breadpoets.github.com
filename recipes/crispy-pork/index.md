"Crispy Pork with Avocado Salsa and Tomato Salsa"


Obtain some boneless pork ribs, country-style.
Trim, chunk, and simmer covered for a while
with water, OJ, garlic, orange peel
   and salt. Drink wine. Uncover when you feel
the ribs are very tender. Now the trick:
Evaporate until the mixture's thick.
Add brandy, stirring often, and the meat
will brown and crisp, divinely touched by heat.

To serve, make guacamole (lots of lime).
Wrap in tortillas. Easy but sublime.
