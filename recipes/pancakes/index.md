"Impromptu Pancakes"


My favorite pancakes are more ratio
than recipe. Use any grains you know
and like: for instance cornmeal, oats, and whole-
  wheat flour. For every cup, add to your bowl
a teaspoon baking powder, half of salt,
and quarter cup of sugar. Maybe malt.
The wet ingredients: a tablespoon
of butter, one of oil, some milk, and soon
before you griddle, fold a beaten white.
Fry up a sample; make the sweetness right
by whisking B-grade maple syrup straight
into the bowl. Cook golden-brown and plate
with over-easy eggs â€” some syrup on
the side. Enjoy, because they'll soon be gone!
