<p class="main">
<br>
First the chickpeas, because we want them to become<br>
little crispy firecrackers,<br>
we want for them a snack-food addictiveness<br>
that entices plump fingers into the pot.<br>
Then clear the way for tofu, give it room to breathe<br>
and time to brown, annointing it with oil, saying prayers<br>
to appease the gods of nonstick.<br>
Now it's all downhill, onion and squash and tight curls of kale,<br>
just coasting, lemon-zest-boosting,<br>
lemon-juice-sluicing past the finish line,<br>
an easy victory.<br>
And as we all know,<br>
victory is sweet.
